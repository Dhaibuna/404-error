**[This is a 404 page](https://dhaibuna.github.io/404-error/)**



## Ressources used to create this page : 

- [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) 

Allows you to create little pixel images, that you can choose to save into **.gif** or **png** in order to create sprite, that you will animate as I did. 


- To do spritessheets once you've made up your **.png** :  [A generator](https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer)

- And the last but not least : [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)  

No, I don't know how to create by heart animations like this one, yet very simple : 


``` 
aside a:hover{
    animation-name: hover-link;
    animation-duration: 5s ;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    text-decoration: underline;
    text-decoration-color: yellow ;
}

/* Animations */

@keyframes hover-link {
    0%   {text-decoration-color: yellow;}
    25%  {text-decoration-color: #56E0CC;}
    50%  {text-decoration-color: #FBB451;}
    100% {text-decoration-color :#FD0000;}
  }
  ```





Enjoy :)
